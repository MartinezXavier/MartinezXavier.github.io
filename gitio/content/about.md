# About me

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at LBT (Laboratoire de Biochimie Theorique) in Paris, in Marc Baaden's team working on UnityMol, a molecular viewer built in Unity game engine.

During my Ph.D at LIMSI, VENISE team in Orsay under supervision of [Patrick Bourdot](https://perso.limsi.fr/pb/), I worked on creating a tangible interface for interacting with molecular simulations like protein-protein docking or IMD (interactive molecular dynamics).
Thanks to a recent collaboration between [Nicolas FÃ©rey](https://perso.limsi.fr/ferey/contact.html) and [Bastien Vincke](http://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/la-recherche/pole-siame-systemes-d-information-et-d-analyse-multi-environnements/groupe-moss-methodes-et-outils-pour-les-signaux-et-systemes/vincke-bastien-343042.kjsp?RH=1363876775651), the project evolved to embed electronical parts like sensors.

I also started to work in Unity and molecular visualization during my Ph.D, particularly on improving classical molecular representations and bridging the gap between the computer science domain with advanced computer graphics technics and structural biologists with common tools like VMD/Pymol/Chimera (paper in [Structure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212619303077))

This led me to work on UnityMol with that I completely re-wrote in 2018 because the code maintenance was a nightmare. UnityMol/[Marc Baaden](http://www.baaden.ibpc.fr/) gave me the opportunity to learn and improve on many fields and techniques like VR/AR/MR, human-computer interaction, GPU computing, computer graphics and obviously Unity/C# & C++ and much more.

As a post-doc in a public research lab, I also wanted to keep a strong link with the industry and have a direct application of my work. This was made possible thanks to our collaboration with UCB pharma, that supported my post-doc during 2 years and greatly helped to improve UnityMol.

<!-- The main goal was to markerlessly reconstruct in 3D, a modular and flexible physical model with only one standard RGB camera.
Combining computer vision methods in OpenCV for real time tracking of the molecular model with a custom implementation of the structure from motion (SFM) method to reconstruct 3D atom positions allowed me to get a robust numerical representation of the molecule.

This was the first step to convert a flexible physical model into a tangible interface. The next step was to embed sensors inside the physical model to obtain precise torsion angles in interactive time to both reconstruct the model but also to follow deformation.
